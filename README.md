This is a project I completed as a student at [hackreactor](http://hackreactor.com).

File
1. index.html - Homepage
2. detectNetwork.js - Given a credit card number, the function should return a string with the name of a network, 
                      by detecting the prefix and length of the card number.
3. detectNetwork.test.js - Full auto test coverage
4. runner.js
